# WeatherComponent

The UI Kit project is designed to display weather information using the `WeatherKit` framework provided by Apple. 

The project includes a custom `LoadingView` that displays a message and activity indicator while data is being retrieved, and a `WeatherView` that presents the current location, temperature, weather conditions using icons and descriptive labels. 

The project is implemented using Swift programming language, UIKit framework, and includes the use of constraints for layout and autoresizing masks for supporting different device sizes.

It's really easy to implement and take just few lines of code, so, feel free to use.

## WeatherKit

WeatherKit is a framework developed by Apple that provides a way for developers to access weather data and forecast information from the National Weather Service. It provides access to a wide range of weather information such as current conditions, hourly forecasts, and daily forecasts. 

The framework includes a set of classes and protocols that make it easy to work with weather data, as well as tools for formatting the data for display in a user interface. By using `WeatherKit`, developers can easily add weather functionality to their apps without having to build complex data acquisition and parsing systems.

**How to use**

To use `WeatherKit` in your project, you need to add the `WeatherKit framework to your Xcode project. You can do this by selecting your project in the Project Navigator, selecting the target you want to add the framework to, and then selecting the "Signing and capabilities" tab. From there, you can tap plus button and add the WeatherKit to your project.

Additionally you need to turn on `Weather Kit` in App Services on your Apple Developer account (Identifiers -> You project name -> Tab App services) [Link](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list)

Once you have added the framework to your project, you can then import the `WeatherKit` module into your source code files using the import `WeatherKit` statement. From there, you can use the classes and methods provided by the framework to fetch weather data and display it in your app.

**Implementation in code**

To implement `WeatherKit` in your code, you will need to follow these general steps:

 - Import the `WeatherKit` framework to your project.
 - Request access to the user's location. 
 - Create an instance of `WeatherService`
 - Use `WeatherService` to request the current weather data based on the user's location. 
 - Parse the returned data and use it to update your UI.

You can find implementation in `ViewController` in repo.

**UI implementation**

The `WeatherView` class is a subclass of `UIView` that is responsible for displaying the weather information to the user. It has several UI elements such as `iconView`, `tempLabel`, `feelsLikeLabel`, `lastUpdateLabel`, and `locationLabel` which are used to display different aspects of the weather data. The `loadingView` is a custom view that is displayed while the weather data is being fetched.

The `init(frame:)` method sets up the layout of the UI elements using Auto Layout constraints. The `configure(with:location:)` method is used to update the UI with the weather data and the location information. If the location information is available, it is used to update the `locationLabel` using reverse geocoding. If the weather data is available, it is used to update the `iconView`, `tempLabel`, `feelsLikeLabel`, and `lastUpdateLabel` with the relevant weather information.

Overall, the `WeatherView` class encapsulates the UI logic for displaying the weather information and provides a clean separation of concerns between the UI and the data/model layer.

The `loadingView` is a UI element used to indicate that data is currently being fetched and the app is waiting for a response. When the view is first initialized, it is hidden from view. When data is being loaded, it is shown to the user, and when the data has been loaded and is ready to be displayed, it is hidden again. This provides a visual cue to the user that the app is actively doing something in the background and that they should wait for the data to be fully loaded before interacting with the app.
